### Measuring a healthy life of young adults and teenagers 

Creating a survey about how students and young adults are having healthy life and collecting data on quantitative variables. I analyzed data using SAS tools see if there are any correlation between variables.

# Description & Data

I had a survey of students including middle school, high school, and college students, which the
age ranges from 18 to 30s, the healthy life by measuring how many days they eat breakfast,
drink alcohol, eat out, and eat instant food a week. I pick breakfast and eating out as my two
qualitative variables for my pertinent results. The median of eating breakfast a week was 3.0
with an IQR of 6.0 days. The median of eating out a week was 2.0 with an IQR of 5.0 days. I used
the median and IQR for my center and spread based on the box plot, which shows you the
outliers and correspondingly, the both of distribution doesn’t look normal as you can see the
plot as well. After the survey, I feel like I should have asked in different questions to have some
exclusive relationship so that I can make the more productive conclusion. During the survey,
everyone was cooperative in answering my questions and I felt I asked the appropriate and right
amount of questions.
